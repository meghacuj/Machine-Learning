This project developed a regression model to analyze and predict the fuel consumption of light-duty vehicles in Canada from 1995 to 2014. The dataset included model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated CO₂ emissions, adjusted to reflect 5-cycle testing. Key predictors such as model year, engine size, and CO₂ emissions were used to build the model. The regression analysis revealed trends in fuel efficiency over time and identified the most significant factors affecting fuel consumption.
